# nextnanopy-wrapper
The package `nnShortcuts` contains shortcut functions using nextnanopy features and simplifies the pre- and post-processing of nextnano simulations.
The package `SweepHelper` is an object-oriented wrapper around nextnanopy. This class object facilitates preparing, running and post-processing nextnano sweep simulations by bridging the simulation inputs and outputs.

## How to use
```python
# nextnano++ shortcut functions
import nnShortcuts.nnp_shortcuts as nnp

# class module for sweep simulations
import SweepHelper as helper
```
