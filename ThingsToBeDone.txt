[all]
- add option to use nextnano corporate colormap in 2D plot methods
- visualization of warning in yellow (error will be in red, info in default colour)

[unit test]


[nnShortcuts]
- resolve TODOs in each file
- add usage example of shortcuts
- Following David Stark's code, 
  1. support interpolated colormaps (using contourf in python) + adding a line which indicates the waveguide losses
  2. plot oscillator strengths for colored transitions
- 10^19 instead of 1e+1 in ylabel of the charge density 
- use labelsize and ticsize also for plot_inplaneK()
- avoid output PDF filename conflict between plot_carrier_density() and plot_probabilities() 

[NEGFShortcuts]
- create an option for legend loc='lower left'
- would be cool to have animation of band diagram & DOS as a function of bias (Winter School, Gerhard Klimeck)

[object-oriented approach]
- is it possible to move imports to __init__? or at least to the parent class
- if the difference between overridden methods is only 'software', they can be defined in the parent.

[SweepHelper]
- update the example with latest features/options
- add an example with Slurm job submission
- add an option 'outfolder_name' in execute_sweep()
- get generate_gif working

[README]


[nnResults] object-oriented approach to postprocessing, inspired by kwant
- define a parent class Results
- within Results, define plotter class
- implement plotter methods using nnShortcuts 
- add png image to ReadMe if possible. Looks proffesional
