[nnShortcuts]
- rename base.py to common.py
- implement Python warnings
- NextnanopyScriptError really needed? used?
- Following David Stark's code, 
  1. support interpolated colormaps (using contourf in python) + adding a line which indicates the waveguide losses
  2. plot oscillator strengths for colored transitions
- 10^19 instead of 1e+1 in ylabel of the charge density 
- use base.labelsize_default in all nnp plot methods
- use labelsize and ticsize also for plot_inplaneK()
- use base.getDataFile() in nnp.getDataFile_probabilities_in_folder -> can profit from new features in base e.g. exclude_keywords
- avoid output PDF filename conflict between plot_carrier_density() and plot_probabilities() 

[SweepHelper]
- get generate_gif working
- add plot_probabilities
