[nnShortcuts]
- resolve TODOs in each file
- add useage example of shortcuts
- Following David Stark's code, 
  1. support interpolated colormaps (using contourf in python) + adding a line which indicates the waveguide losses
  2. plot oscillator strengths for colored transitions
- 10^19 instead of 1e+1 in ylabel of the charge density 
- use labelsize and ticsize also for plot_inplaneK()
- avoid output PDF filename conflict between plot_carrier_density() and plot_probabilities() 

[SweepHelper]
- add an example to demonstrate usage
- get generate_gif working
- add plot_probabilities
