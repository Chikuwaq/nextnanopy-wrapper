[all]
- use nextnano corporate colormap in 2D plot methods
- format warnings console output
- visualization of warning in yellow (error will be in red, info in default colour)

[unit test]


[nnShortcuts]
- resolve TODOs in each file
- add usage example of shortcuts
- Following David Stark's code, 
  1. support interpolated colormaps (using contourf in python) + adding a line which indicates the waveguide losses
  2. plot oscillator strengths for colored transitions
- 10^19 instead of 1e+1 in ylabel of the charge density 
- use labelsize and ticsize also for plot_inplaneK()
- avoid output PDF filename conflict between plot_carrier_density() and plot_probabilities() 

[NEGFShortcuts]
- create an option for legend loc='lower left'
- would be cool to have animation of band diagram & DOS as a function of bias (Winter School, Gerhard Klimeck)

[object-oriented approach]
- benefit of using classes is that the methods don't need to be defined above the code line of invocation. Bring the major methods up, auxilirary methods to the bottom.
E.g. get_states_to_be_plotted()
- is it possible to move imports to __init__? or at least to the parent class
- if the difference between overridden methods is only 'software', they can be defined in the parent.

[SweepHelper]
- add an example to demonstrate usage
- add an option 'outfolder_name' in execute_sweep()
- get generate_gif working

[README]


[nnResults] object-oriented approach to post-processing, inspired by kwant
- define a parent class Results
- within Results, define plotter class
- implement plotter methods using nnShortcuts 
- add png image to ReadMe if possible. Looks proffesional
